## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```dart
// Initialize (automatic with SuperBetterAuth)
final orgPlugin = OrganizationPlugin.instance;

// Create organization
final org = await orgPlugin.createOrganization(
  name: "My Company",
  slug: "my-company",
);

// Invite member
final invitation = await orgPlugin.inviteMember(
  email: "user@example.com",
  role: "member",
);

// List organizations
final organizations = await orgPlugin.listOrganizations();
```

### Advanced Usage with Client

```dart
// Direct API access
final client = SuperBetterAuth.client.organization;
final result = await client.createOrganization(
  body: CreateOrganizationRequest(
    name: "Test Org",
    slug: "test-org",
  ),
);

if (result.isSuccess) {
  print("Created: ${result.data?.organization.name}");
}
```

### UI Integration

```dart
// Use the provided widget
OrganizationWidget(
  onOrganizationChanged: (org) {
    print("Active organization: ${org.name}");
  },
)

// Or the full example app
OrganizationExample()
```

## 🔧 Backend Requirements

This implementation requires the Better Auth backend with organization plugin:

```typescript
import { betterAuth } from "better-auth"
import { organization } from "better-auth/plugins"

export const auth = betterAuth({
  plugins: [
    organization({
      allowUserToCreateOrganization: true,
      membershipLimit: 100,
      // ... other options
    })
  ]
})
```

## 📋 Database Schema

The implementation expects these tables:
- `organization` - Organization details
- `member` - Organization members with roles
- `invitation` - Member invitations
- `team` - Teams within organizations (optional)
- `teamMember` - Team membership (optional)
- `session` - Extended with active organization/team IDs

## 🎨 UI Components

### OrganizationWidget
A simple, ready-to-use widget for organization selection and basic management.

### OrganizationExample
A comprehensive demo showing all organization features in a tabbed interface.

## ⚠️ Current Limitations

1. **Code Generation**: JSON serialization files (.g.dart) need to be generated using `flutter packages pub run build_runner build`
2. **Retrofit Generation**: API client files (.g.dart) need generation
3. **Error Handling**: Currently uses simple null checks; could be enhanced with proper error types
4. **Permissions**: Access control implementation would need backend permission validation
5. **Real-time Updates**: No WebSocket/SSE support for real-time organization changes

## 🔄 Next Steps

To complete the implementation:

1. Run code generation:
   ```bash
   flutter packages pub run build_runner build
   ```

2. Test with Better Auth backend
3. Add permission-based UI controls
4. Implement real-time updates
5. Add more comprehensive error handling
6. Add unit tests
